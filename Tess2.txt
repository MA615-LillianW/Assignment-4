110 "On an evening in the latter part of May a middle-aged man was walking"
110 "homeward from Shaston to the village of Marlott, in the adjoining Vale"
110 "of Blakemore, or Blackmoor. The pair of legs that carried him were"
110 "rickety, and there was a bias in his gait which inclined him somewhat"
110 "to the left of a straight line. He occasionally gave a smart nod, as if"
110 "in confirmation of some opinion, though he was not thinking of anything"
110 "in particular. An empty egg-basket was slung upon his arm, the nap of"
110 "his hat was ruffled, a patch being quite worn away at its brim where"
110 "his thumb came in taking it off. Presently he was met by an elderly"
110 "parson astride on a gray mare, who, as he rode, hummed a wandering"
110 "tune."
110 ""
110 "“Good night t’ee,” said the man with the basket."
110 ""
110 "“Good night, Sir John,” said the parson."
110 ""
110 "The pedestrian, after another pace or two, halted, and turned round."
110 ""
110 "“Now, sir, begging your pardon; we met last market-day on this road"
110 "about this time, and I said ‘Good night,’ and you made reply ‘_Good"
110 "night, Sir John_,’ as now.”"
110 ""
110 "“I did,” said the parson."
110 ""
110 "“And once before that—near a month ago.”"
110 ""
110 "“I may have.”"
110 ""
110 "“Then what might your meaning be in calling me ‘Sir John’ these"
110 "different times, when I be plain Jack Durbeyfield, the haggler?”"
110 ""
110 "The parson rode a step or two nearer."
110 ""
110 "“It was only my whim,” he said; and, after a moment’s hesitation: “It"
110 "was on account of a discovery I made some little time ago, whilst I was"
110 "hunting up pedigrees for the new county history. I am Parson Tringham,"
110 "the antiquary, of Stagfoot Lane. Don’t you really know, Durbeyfield,"
110 "that you are the lineal representative of the ancient and knightly"
110 "family of the d’Urbervilles, who derive their descent from Sir Pagan"
110 "d’Urberville, that renowned knight who came from Normandy with William"
110 "the Conqueror, as appears by Battle Abbey Roll?”"
110 ""
110 "“Never heard it before, sir!”"
110 ""
110 "“Well it’s true. Throw up your chin a moment, so that I may catch the"
110 "profile of your face better. Yes, that’s the d’Urberville nose and"
110 "chin—a little debased. Your ancestor was one of the twelve knights who"
110 "assisted the Lord of Estremavilla in Normandy in his conquest of"
110 "Glamorganshire. Branches of your family held manors over all this part"
110 "of England; their names appear in the Pipe Rolls in the time of King"
110 "Stephen. In the reign of King John one of them was rich enough to give"
110 "a manor to the Knights Hospitallers; and in Edward the Second’s time"
110 "your forefather Brian was summoned to Westminster to attend the great"
110 "Council there. You declined a little in Oliver Cromwell’s time, but to"
110 "no serious extent, and in Charles the Second’s reign you were made"
110 "Knights of the Royal Oak for your loyalty. Aye, there have been"
110 "generations of Sir Johns among you, and if knighthood were hereditary,"
110 "like a baronetcy, as it practically was in old times, when men were"
110 "knighted from father to son, you would be Sir John now.”"
110 ""
110 "“Ye don’t say so!”"
110 ""
110 "“In short,” concluded the parson, decisively smacking his leg with his"
110 "switch, “there’s hardly such another family in England.”"
110 ""
110 "“Daze my eyes, and isn’t there?” said Durbeyfield. “And here have I"
110 "been knocking about, year after year, from pillar to post, as if I was"
110 "no more than the commonest feller in the parish.... And how long hev"
110 "this news about me been knowed, Pa’son Tringham?”"
110 ""
110 "The clergyman explained that, as far as he was aware, it had quite died"
110 "out of knowledge, and could hardly be said to be known at all. His own"
110 "investigations had begun on a day in the preceding spring when, having"
110 "been engaged in tracing the vicissitudes of the d’Urberville family, he"
110 "had observed Durbeyfield’s name on his waggon, and had thereupon been"
110 "led to make inquiries about his father and grandfather till he had no"
110 "doubt on the subject."
110 ""
110 "“At first I resolved not to disturb you with such a useless piece of"
110 "information,” said he. “However, our impulses are too strong for our"
110 "judgement sometimes. I thought you might perhaps know something of it"
110 "all the while.”"
110 ""
110 "“Well, I have heard once or twice, ’tis true, that my family had seen"
110 "better days afore they came to Blackmoor. But I took no notice o’t,"
110 "thinking it to mean that we had once kept two horses where we now keep"
110 "only one. I’ve got a wold silver spoon, and a wold graven seal at home,"
110 "too; but, Lord, what’s a spoon and seal?... And to think that I and"
110 "these noble d’Urbervilles were one flesh all the time. ’Twas said that"
110 "my gr’t-granfer had secrets, and didn’t care to talk of where he came"
110 "from.... And where do we raise our smoke, now, parson, if I may make so"
110 "bold; I mean, where do we d’Urbervilles live?”"
110 ""
110 "“You don’t live anywhere. You are extinct—as a county family.”"
110 ""
110 "“That’s bad.”"
110 ""
110 "“Yes—what the mendacious family chronicles call extinct in the male"
110 "line—that is, gone down—gone under.”"
110 ""
110 "“Then where do we lie?”"
110 ""
110 "“At Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill: rows and rows of you in your vaults, with"
110 "your effigies under Purbeck-marble canopies.”"
110 ""
110 "“And where be our family mansions and estates?”"
110 ""
110 "“You haven’t any.”"
110 ""
110 "“Oh? No lands neither?”"
110 ""
110 "“None; though you once had ’em in abundance, as I said, for your family"
110 "consisted of numerous branches. In this county there was a seat of"
110 "yours at Kingsbere, and another at Sherton, and another in Millpond,"
110 "and another at Lullstead, and another at Wellbridge.”"
110 ""
110 "“And shall we ever come into our own again?”"
110 ""
110 "“Ah—that I can’t tell!”"
110 ""
110 "“And what had I better do about it, sir?” asked Durbeyfield, after a"
110 "pause."
110 ""
110 "“Oh—nothing, nothing; except chasten yourself with the thought of ‘how"
110 "are the mighty fallen.’ It is a fact of some interest to the local"
110 "historian and genealogist, nothing more. There are several families"
110 "among the cottagers of this county of almost equal lustre. Good night.”"
110 ""
110 "“But you’ll turn back and have a quart of beer wi’ me on the strength"
110 "o’t, Pa’son Tringham? There’s a very pretty brew in tap at The Pure"
110 "Drop—though, to be sure, not so good as at Rolliver’s.”"
110 ""
110 "“No, thank you—not this evening, Durbeyfield. You’ve had enough"
110 "already.” Concluding thus, the parson rode on his way, with doubts as"
110 "to his discretion in retailing this curious bit of lore."
110 ""
110 "When he was gone, Durbeyfield walked a few steps in a profound reverie,"
110 "and then sat down upon the grassy bank by the roadside, depositing his"
110 "basket before him. In a few minutes a youth appeared in the distance,"
110 "walking in the same direction as that which had been pursued by"
110 "Durbeyfield. The latter, on seeing him, held up his hand, and the lad"
110 "quickened his pace and came near."
110 ""
110 "“Boy, take up that basket! I want ’ee to go on an errand for me.”"
110 ""
110 "The lath-like stripling frowned. “Who be you, then, John Durbeyfield,"
110 "to order me about and call me ‘boy’? You know my name as well as I know"
110 "yours!”"
110 ""
110 "“Do you, do you? That’s the secret—that’s the secret! Now obey my"
110 "orders, and take the message I’m going to charge ’ee wi’... Well, Fred,"
110 "I don’t mind telling you that the secret is that I’m one of a noble"
110 "race—it has been just found out by me this present afternoon, p.m.” And"
110 "as he made the announcement, Durbeyfield, declining from his sitting"
110 "position, luxuriously stretched himself out upon the bank among the"
110 "daisies."
110 ""
110 "The lad stood before Durbeyfield, and contemplated his length from"
110 "crown to toe."
110 ""
110 "“Sir John d’Urberville—that’s who I am,” continued the prostrate man."
110 "“That is if knights were baronets—which they be. ’Tis recorded in"
110 "history all about me. Dost know of such a place, lad, as"
110 "Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill?”"
110 ""
110 "“Ees. I’ve been there to Greenhill Fair.”"
110 ""
110 "“Well, under the church of that city there lie—”"
110 ""
110 "“’Tisn’t a city, the place I mean; leastwise ’twaddn’ when I was"
110 "there—’twas a little one-eyed, blinking sort o’ place.”"
110 ""
110 "“Never you mind the place, boy, that’s not the question before us."
110 "Under the church of that there parish lie my ancestors—hundreds of"
110 "’em—in coats of mail and jewels, in gr’t lead coffins weighing tons and"
110 "tons. There’s not a man in the county o’ South-Wessex that’s got"
110 "grander and nobler skillentons in his family than I.”"
110 ""
110 "“Oh?”"
110 ""
110 "“Now take up that basket, and goo on to Marlott, and when you’ve come"
110 "to The Pure Drop Inn, tell ’em to send a horse and carriage to me"
110 "immed’ately, to carry me hwome. And in the bottom o’ the carriage they"
110 "be to put a noggin o’ rum in a small bottle, and chalk it up to my"
110 "account. And when you’ve done that goo on to my house with the basket,"
110 "and tell my wife to put away that washing, because she needn’t finish"
110 "it, and wait till I come hwome, as I’ve news to tell her.”"
110 ""
110 "As the lad stood in a dubious attitude, Durbeyfield put his hand in his"
110 "pocket, and produced a shilling, one of the chronically few that he"
110 "possessed."
110 ""
110 "“Here’s for your labour, lad.”"
110 ""
110 "This made a difference in the young man’s estimate of the position."
110 ""
110 "“Yes, Sir John. Thank ’ee. Anything else I can do for ’ee, Sir John?”"
110 ""
110 "“Tell ’em at hwome that I should like for supper,—well, lamb’s fry if"
110 "they can get it; and if they can’t, black-pot; and if they can’t get"
110 "that, well chitterlings will do.”"
110 ""
110 "“Yes, Sir John.”"
110 ""
110 "The boy took up the basket, and as he set out the notes of a brass band"
110 "were heard from the direction of the village."
110 ""
110 "“What’s that?” said Durbeyfield. “Not on account o’ I?”"
110 ""
110 "“’Tis the women’s club-walking, Sir John. Why, your da’ter is one o’"
110 "the members.”"
110 ""
110 "“To be sure—I’d quite forgot it in my thoughts of greater things! Well,"
110 "vamp on to Marlott, will ye, and order that carriage, and maybe I’ll"
110 "drive round and inspect the club.”"
110 ""
110 "The lad departed, and Durbeyfield lay waiting on the grass and daisies"
110 "in the evening sun. Not a soul passed that way for a long while, and"
110 "the faint notes of the band were the only human sounds audible within"
110 "the rim of blue hills."
110 ""
110 ""
110 "<CHAPTER II>"
110 ""
110 "The village of Marlott lay amid the north-eastern undulations of the"
110 "beautiful Vale of Blakemore, or Blackmoor, aforesaid, an engirdled and"
110 "secluded region, for the most part untrodden as yet by tourist or"
110 "landscape-painter, though within a four hours’ journey from London."
110 ""
110 "It is a vale whose acquaintance is best made by viewing it from the"
110 "summits of the hills that surround it—except perhaps during the"
110 "droughts of summer. An unguided ramble into its recesses in bad weather"
110 "is apt to engender dissatisfaction with its narrow, tortuous, and miry"
110 "ways."
110 ""
110 "This fertile and sheltered tract of country, in which the fields are"
110 "never brown and the springs never dry, is bounded on the south by the"
110 "bold chalk ridge that embraces the prominences of Hambledon Hill,"
110 "Bulbarrow, Nettlecombe-Tout, Dogbury, High Stoy, and Bubb Down. The"
110 "traveller from the coast, who, after plodding northward for a score of"
110 "miles over calcareous downs and corn-lands, suddenly reaches the verge"
110 "of one of these escarpments, is surprised and delighted to behold,"
110 "extended like a map beneath him, a country differing absolutely from"
110 "that which he has passed through. Behind him the hills are open, the"
110 "sun blazes down upon fields so large as to give an unenclosed character"
110 "to the landscape, the lanes are white, the hedges low and plashed, the"
110 "atmosphere colourless. Here, in the valley, the world seems to be"
110 "constructed upon a smaller and more delicate scale; the fields are mere"
110 "paddocks, so reduced that from this height their hedgerows appear a"
110 "network of dark green threads overspreading the paler green of the"
110 "grass. The atmosphere beneath is languorous, and is so tinged with"
110 "azure that what artists call the middle distance partakes also of that"
110 "hue, while the horizon beyond is of the deepest ultramarine. Arable"
110 "lands are few and limited; with but slight exceptions the prospect is a"
110 "broad rich mass of grass and trees, mantling minor hills and dales"
110 "within the major. Such is the Vale of Blackmoor."
110 ""
110 "The district is of historic, no less than of topographical interest."
110 "The Vale was known in former times as the Forest of White Hart, from a"
110 "curious legend of King Henry III’s reign, in which the killing by a"
110 "certain Thomas de la Lynd of a beautiful white hart which the king had"
110 "run down and spared, was made the occasion of a heavy fine. In those"
110 "days, and till comparatively recent times, the country was densely"
110 "wooded. Even now, traces of its earlier condition are to be found in"
110 "the old oak copses and irregular belts of timber that yet survive upon"
110 "its slopes, and the hollow-trunked trees that shade so many of its"
110 "pastures."
110 ""
110 "The forests have departed, but some old customs of their shades remain."
110 "Many, however, linger only in a metamorphosed or disguised form. The"
110 "May-Day dance, for instance, was to be discerned on the afternoon under"
110 "notice, in the guise of the club revel, or “club-walking,” as it was"
110 "there called."
110 ""
110 "It was an interesting event to the younger inhabitants of Marlott,"
110 "though its real interest was not observed by the participators in the"
110 "ceremony. Its singularity lay less in the retention of a custom of"
110 "walking in procession and dancing on each anniversary than in the"
110 "members being solely women. In men’s clubs such celebrations were,"
110 "though expiring, less uncommon; but either the natural shyness of the"
110 "softer sex, or a sarcastic attitude on the part of male relatives, had"
110 "denuded such women’s clubs as remained (if any other did) or this their"
110 "glory and consummation. The club of Marlott alone lived to uphold the"
110 "local Cerealia. It had walked for hundreds of years, if not as"
110 "benefit-club, as votive sisterhood of some sort; and it walked still."
110 ""
110 "The banded ones were all dressed in white gowns—a gay survival from Old"
110 "Style days, when cheerfulness and May-time were synonyms—days before"
110 "the habit of taking long views had reduced emotions to a monotonous"
110 "average. Their first exhibition of themselves was in a processional"
110 "march of two and two round the parish. Ideal and real clashed slightly"
110 "as the sun lit up their figures against the green hedges and"
110 "creeper-laced house-fronts; for, though the whole troop wore white"
110 "garments, no two whites were alike among them. Some approached pure"
110 "blanching; some had a bluish pallor; some worn by the older characters"
110 "(which had possibly lain by folded for many a year) inclined to a"
110 "cadaverous tint, and to a Georgian style."
110 ""
110 "In addition to the distinction of a white frock, every woman and girl"
110 "carried in her right hand a peeled willow wand, and in her left a bunch"
110 "of white flowers. The peeling of the former, and the selection of the"
110 "latter, had been an operation of personal care."
110 ""
110 "There were a few middle-aged and even elderly women in the train, their"
110 "silver-wiry hair and wrinkled faces, scourged by time and trouble,"
110 "having almost a grotesque, certainly a pathetic, appearance in such a"
110 "jaunty situation. In a true view, perhaps, there was more to be"
110 "gathered and told of each anxious and experienced one, to whom the"
110 "years were drawing nigh when she should say, “I have no pleasure in"
110 "them,” than of her juvenile comrades. But let the elder be passed over"
110 "here for those under whose bodices the life throbbed quick and warm."
110 ""
110 "The young girls formed, indeed, the majority of the band, and their"
110 "heads of luxuriant hair reflected in the sunshine every tone of gold,"
110 "and black, and brown. Some had beautiful eyes, others a beautiful nose,"
110 "others a beautiful mouth and figure: few, if any, had all. A difficulty"
110 "of arranging their lips in this crude exposure to public scrutiny, an"
110 "inability to balance their heads, and to dissociate self-consciousness"
110 "from their features, was apparent in them, and showed that they were"
110 "genuine country girls, unaccustomed to many eyes."
110 ""
110 "And as each and all of them were warmed without by the sun, so each had"
110 "a private little sun for her soul to bask in; some dream, some"
110 "affection, some hobby, at least some remote and distant hope which,"
110 "though perhaps starving to nothing, still lived on, as hopes will. They"
110 "were all cheerful, and many of them merry."
110 ""
110 "They came round by The Pure Drop Inn, and were turning out of the high"
110 "road to pass through a wicket-gate into the meadows, when one of the"
110 "women said—"
110 ""
110 "“The Load-a-Lord! Why, Tess Durbeyfield, if there isn’t thy father"
110 "riding hwome in a carriage!”"
110 ""
110 "A young member of the band turned her head at the exclamation. She was"
110 "a fine and handsome girl—not handsomer than some others, possibly—but"
110 "her mobile peony mouth and large innocent eyes added eloquence to"
110 "colour and shape. She wore a red ribbon in her hair, and was the only"
110 "one of the white company who could boast of such a pronounced"
110 "adornment. As she looked round Durbeyfield was seen moving along the"
110 "road in a chaise belonging to The Pure Drop, driven by a frizzle-headed"
110 "brawny damsel with her gown-sleeves rolled above her elbows. This was"
110 "the cheerful servant of that establishment, who, in her part of"
110 "factotum, turned groom and ostler at times. Durbeyfield, leaning back,"
110 "and with his eyes closed luxuriously, was waving his hand above his"
110 "head, and singing in a slow recitative—"
110 ""
110 "“I’ve-got-a-gr’t-family-vault-at-Kingsbere—and"
110 "knighted-forefathers-in-lead-coffins-there!”"
110 ""
110 "The clubbists tittered, except the girl called Tess—in whom a slow heat"
110 "seemed to rise at the sense that her father was making himself foolish"
110 "in their eyes."
110 ""
110 "“He’s tired, that’s all,” she said hastily, “and he has got a lift"
110 "home, because our own horse has to rest to-day.”"
110 ""
110 "“Bless thy simplicity, Tess,” said her companions. “He’s got his"
110 "market-nitch. Haw-haw!”"
110 ""
110 "“Look here; I won’t walk another inch with you, if you say any jokes"
110 "about him!” Tess cried, and the colour upon her cheeks spread over her"
110 "face and neck. In a moment her eyes grew moist, and her glance drooped"
110 "to the ground. Perceiving that they had really pained her they said no"
110 "more, and order again prevailed. Tess’s pride would not allow her to"
110 "turn her head again, to learn what her father’s meaning was, if he had"
110 "any; and thus she moved on with the whole body to the enclosure where"
110 "there was to be dancing on the green. By the time the spot was reached"
110 "she had recovered her equanimity, and tapped her neighbour with her"
110 "wand and talked as usual."
110 ""
110 "Tess Durbeyfield at this time of her life was a mere vessel of emotion"
110 "untinctured by experience. The dialect was on her tongue to some"
110 "extent, despite the village school: the characteristic intonation of"
110 "that dialect for this district being the voicing approximately rendered"
110 "by the syllable UR, probably as rich an utterance as any to be found in"
110 "human speech. The pouted-up deep red mouth to which this syllable was"
110 "native had hardly as yet settled into its definite shape, and her lower"
110 "lip had a way of thrusting the middle of her top one upward, when they"
110 "closed together after a word."
110 ""
110 "Phases of her childhood lurked in her aspect still. As she walked along"
110 "to-day, for all her bouncing handsome womanliness, you could sometimes"
110 "see her twelfth year in her cheeks, or her ninth sparkling from her"
110 "eyes; and even her fifth would flit over the curves of her mouth now"
110 "and then."
110 ""
110 "Yet few knew, and still fewer considered this. A small minority, mainly"
110 "strangers, would look long at her in casually passing by, and grow"
110 "momentarily fascinated by her freshness, and wonder if they would ever"
110 "see her again: but to almost everybody she was a fine and picturesque"
110 "country girl, and no more."
110 ""
110 "Nothing was seen or heard further of Durbeyfield in his triumphal"
110 "chariot under the conduct of the ostleress, and the club having entered"
110 "the allotted space, dancing began. As there were no men in the company,"
110 "the girls danced at first with each other, but when the hour for the"
110 "close of labour drew on, the masculine inhabitants of the village,"
110 "together with other idlers and pedestrians, gathered round the spot,"
110 "and appeared inclined to negotiate for a partner."
110 ""
110 "Among these on-lookers were three young men of a superior class,"
110 "carrying small knapsacks strapped to their shoulders, and stout sticks"
110 "in their hands. Their general likeness to each other, and their"
110 "consecutive ages, would almost have suggested that they might be, what"
110 "in fact they were, brothers. The eldest wore the white tie, high"
110 "waistcoat, and thin-brimmed hat of the regulation curate; the second"
110 "was the normal undergraduate; the appearance of the third and youngest"
110 "would hardly have been sufficient to characterize him; there was an"
110 "uncribbed, uncabined aspect in his eyes and attire, implying that he"
110 "had hardly as yet found the entrance to his professional groove. That"
110 "he was a desultory tentative student of something and everything might"
110 "only have been predicted of him."

110 "These three brethren told casual acquaintance that they were spending"
110 "their Whitsun holidays in a walking tour through the Vale of Blackmoor,"

110 "north-east."
110 ""
110 "They leant over the gate by the highway, and inquired as to the meaning"
110 "of the dance and the white-frocked maids. The two elder of the brothers"
110 "were plainly not intending to linger more than a moment, but the"
110 "spectacle of a bevy of girls dancing without male partners seemed to"
110 "amuse the third, and make him in no hurry to move on. He unstrapped his"

110 "a hundred prismatic hues were reflected from it. Prince lay alongside,"

110 "infancy, and what had been mystery to her then was not much less than"
110 "mystery to her now. She had seen daily from her chamber-window towers,"
110 "villages, faint white mansions; above all, the town of Shaston standing"
110 "majestically on its height; its windows shining like lamps in the"
110 "evening sun. She had hardly ever visited the place, only a small tract"
110 "even of the Vale and its environs being known to her by close"
110 "inspection. Much less had she been far outside the valley. Every"
110 "contour of the surrounding hills was as personal to her as that of her"
110 "relatives’ faces; but for what lay beyond, her judgment was dependent"
110 "on the teaching of the village school, where she had held a leading"
110 "place at the time of her leaving, a year or two before this date."

110 "In those early days she had been much loved by others of her own sex"

110 "middle one—in a pink print pinafore, of a finely reticulated pattern,"
110 "worn over a stuff frock that had lost its original colour for a"
110 "nondescript tertiary—marching on upon long stalky legs, in tight"
110 "stockings which had little ladder-like holes at the knees, torn by"
110 "kneeling in the roads and banks in search of vegetable and mineral"

110 "provide for them. Her mother’s intelligence was that of a happy child:"

110 "In the ill-judged execution of the well-judged plan of things the call"

110 "outworn game. We may wonder whether at the acme and summit of the human"
110 "progress these anachronisms will be corrected by a finer intuition, a"
110 "closer interaction of the social machinery than that which now jolts us"
110 "round and along; but such completeness is not to be prophesied, or even"
110 "conceived as possible. Enough that in the present case, as in millions,"
110 "it was not the two halves of a perfect whole that confronted each other"
110 "at the perfect moment; a missing counterpart wandered independently"
110 "about the earth waiting in crass obtuseness till the late time came."

110 "Her mother perceived, for the first time, that the second vehicle was"

110 "three- or four-and-twenty, with a cigar between his teeth; wearing a"
110 "dandy cap, drab jacket, breeches of the same hue, white neckcloth,"
110 "stick-up collar, and brown driving-gloves—in short, he was the"

110 "In the evening they returned to the inn at which they had put up, and"

110 "were continually going in and out. As the door opened and shut each"
110 "time for the passage of these, the light within the parlour fell full"
110 "upon Tess’s face. Two men came out and passed by her among the rest."
110 "One of them had stared her up and down in surprise, and she fancied he"
110 "was a Trantridge man, though that village lay so many miles off that"

110 "The man recovered himself, and seemed inclined to come on, and Clare,"
110 "stepping outside the door, put himself in a posture of defence. But his"

110 "the blow; and thus they parted, bidding each other a pacific good"

110 "that I was fighting that fellow again who insulted you, and the noise"
110 "you heard was my pummelling away with my fists at my portmanteau, which"

110 "nothing. So the day passed, and it was evident that whatever he thought"

110 "before. Could it be that her doubts were childish? that he forgave her;"
110 "that he loved her for what she was, just as she was, and smiled at her"

110 "its name. Immediately behind it stood the house wherein they had"
110 "engaged lodgings, whose exterior features are so well known to all"
110 "travellers through the Froom Valley; once portion of a fine manorial"
110 "residence, and the property and seat of a d’Urberville, but since its"

110 "On entering they found that, though they had only engaged a couple of"
110 "rooms, the farmer had taken advantage of their proposed presence during"
110 "the coming days to pay a New Year’s visit to some friends, leaving a"
110 "woman from a neighbouring cottage to minister to their few wants. The"
110 "absoluteness of possession pleased them, and they realized it as the"
110 "first moment of their experience under their own exclusive roof-tree."

110 "But he found that the mouldy old habitation somewhat depressed his"

110 "He looked up, and perceived two life-size portraits on panels built"
110 "into the masonry. As all visitors to the mansion are aware, these"
110 "paintings represent women of middle age, of a date some two hundred"
110 "years ago, whose lineaments once seen can never be forgotten. The long"
110 "pointed features, narrow eye, and smirk of the one, so suggestive of"
110 "merciless treachery; the bill-hook nose, large teeth, and bold eye of"
110 "the other suggesting arrogance to the point of ferocity, haunt the"

110 "The unpleasantness of the matter was that, in addition to their effect"

110 "that he had gone out of his way to choose the house for their bridal"
110 "time, went on into the adjoining room. The place having been rather"
110 "hastily prepared for them, they washed their hands in one basin. Clare"

110 "set upon her. They went into the ancient parlour to tea, and here they"
110 "shared their first common meal alone. Such was their childishness, or"
110 "rather his, that he found it interesting to use the same"
110 "bread-and-butter plate as herself, and to brush crumbs from her lips"

110 "Looking at her silently for a long time; “She is a dear dear Tess,” he"

110 "close in, and the luggage did not arrive, and they had brought nothing"
110 "more than they stood in. With the departure of the sun the calm mood of"
110 "the winter day changed. Out of doors there began noises as of silk"

110 "    Mrs Pitney, when you were a lad, she—vain, kind woman that she"
110 "    was—left to me a portion of the contents of her jewel-case in trust"
110 "    for your wife, if you should ever have one, as a mark of her"
110 "    affection for you and whomsoever you should choose. This trust I"
110 "    have fulfilled, and the diamonds have been locked up at my banker’s"
110 "    ever since. Though I feel it to be a somewhat incongruous act in"
110 "    the circumstances, I am, as you will see, bound to hand over the"
110 "    articles to the woman to whom the use of them for her lifetime will"
110 "    now rightly belong, and they are therefore promptly sent. They"
110 "    become, I believe, heirlooms, strictly speaking, according to the"
110 "    terms of your godmother’s will. The precise words of the clause"
110 "    that refers to this matter are enclosed."
110 ""
110 ""
110 "“I do remember,” said Clare; “but I had quite forgotten.”"

110 "had prophesied a wondrous career for him. There had seemed nothing at"
110 "all out of keeping with such a conjectured career in the storing up of"
110 "these showy ornaments for his wife and the wives of her descendants."
110 "They gleamed somewhat ironically now. “Yet why?” he asked himself. It"
110 "was but a question of vanity throughout; and if that were admitted into"
110 "one side of the equation it should be admitted into the other. His wife"

110 ""
110 "As everybody knows, fine feathers make fine birds; a peasant girl but"
110 "very moderately prepossessing to the casual observer in her simple"

110 "woman of fashion with the aids that Art can render; while the beauty of"

110 "Such sleep as she got was naturally fitful; she fancied she heard"
110 "strange noises, but persuaded herself that they were caused by the"

110 "other side of the globe, while she was here in the cold. Was there"
110 "another such a wretched being as she in the world? Tess asked herself;"
110 "and, thinking of her wasted life, said, “All is vanity.” She repeated"
110 "the words mechanically, till she reflected that this was a most"
110 "inadequate thought for modern days. Solomon had thought as far as that"
110 "more than two thousand years ago; she herself, though not in the van of"
110 "thinkers, had got much further. If all were only vanity, who would mind"
110 "it? All was, alas, worse than vanity—injustice, punishment, exaction,"
110 "death. The wife of Angel Clare put her hand to her brow, and felt its"
110 "curve, and the edges of her eye-sockets perceptible under the soft"

110 "was a sort of gasp or gurgle. Soon she was certain that the noises came"
110 "from wild creatures of some kind, the more so when, originating in the"
110 "boughs overhead, they were followed by the fall of a heavy body upon"

110 "What he looked he felt. He was in the agricultural world, but not of"

110 "farm to farm, from county to county, for as yet the steam"
110 "threshing-machine was itinerant in this part of Wessex. He spoke in a"
110 "strange northern accent; his thoughts being turned inwards upon"
110 "himself, his eye on his iron charge, hardly perceiving the scenes"
110 "around him, and caring for them not at all: holding only strictly"
110 "necessary intercourse with the natives, as if some ancient doom"
110 "compelled him to wander here against his will in the service of his"
110 "Plutonic master. The long strap which ran from the driving-wheel of his"

110 "untied sheaves, could not stop either, unless Marian changed places"

110 "coated with the corndust, and her white bonnet embrowned by it. She was"
110 "the only woman whose place was upon the machine so as to be shaken"
110 "bodily by its spinning, and the decrease of the stack now separated her"

110 "At length it was the eve of Old Lady-Day, and the agricultural world"

110 "home also of their fathers and grandfathers; but latterly the desire"

110 "it was a pleasant excitement which might possibly be an advantage. The"
110 "Egypt of one family was the Land of Promise to the family who saw it"

110 "father, or copyholders, or occasionally, small freeholders. But as the"
110 "long holdings fell in, they were seldom again let to similar tenants,"
110 "and were mostly pulled down, if not absolutely required by the farmer"
110 "for his hands. Cottagers who were not directly employed on the land"
110 "were looked upon with disfavour, and the banishment of some starved the"
110 "trade of others, who were thus obliged to follow. These families, who"
110 "had formed the backbone of the village life in the past, who were the"
110 "depositaries of the village traditions, had to seek refuge in the large"

110 "temperance, soberness, or chastity. The father, and even the mother,"
110 "had got drunk at times, the younger children seldom had gone to church,"

110 ""
110 "“A stylish lodging-house. ’Tis all lodging-houses here, bless ’ee.”"

110 "more or less northward. But there was an unpractical vagueness in their"
110 "movements throughout the day; neither one of them seemed to consider"

110 "part of the country till he should come back. Her clothes were of"
110 "recent fashion; even the ivory-handled parasol that she carried was of"
110 "a shape unknown in the retired spot to which they had now wandered; and"
110 "the cut of such articles would have attracted attention in the settle"

110 "any emergency arise."

110 "when they have forgotten us, we can make for some port.”"

110 "them into the depths of the New Forest, and towards evening, turning"
110 "the corner of a lane, they perceived behind a brook and bridge a large"
110 "board on which was painted in white letters, “This desirable Mansion to"
110 "be Let Furnished”; particulars following, with directions to apply to"

110 "where she was, whilst he went to see who was within."
110 ""
110 "She sat down among the bushes within the gate, and Clare crept towards"
110 "the house. His absence lasted some considerable time, and when he"
110 "returned Tess was wildly anxious, not for herself, but for him. He had"
110 "found out from a boy that there was only an old woman in charge as"
110 "caretaker, and she only came there on fine days, from the hamlet near,"
110 "to open and shut the windows. She would come to shut them at sunset."
110 "“Now, we can get in through one of the lower windows, and rest there,”"

110 "Under his escort she went tardily forward to the main front, whose"
110 "shuttered windows, like sightless eyeballs, excluded the possibility of"

110 "the hall-window in front and an upper window behind. Clare unlatched"
110 "the door of a large chamber, felt his way across it, and parted the"
110 "shutters to the width of two or three inches. A shaft of dazzling"
110 "sunlight glanced into the room, revealing heavy, old-fashioned"
110 "furniture, crimson damask hangings, and an enormous four-post bedstead,"
110 "along the head of which were carved running figures, apparently"

110 "of their chamber for any casual reason. Between six and seven o’clock"
110 "she came, but did not approach the wing they were in. They heard her"
110 "close the windows, fasten them, lock the door, and go away. Then Clare"
110 "again stole a chink of light from the window, and they shared another"

110 "whispered to him the whole story of how he had walked in his sleep with"
110 "her in his arms across the Froom stream, at the imminent risk of both"

110 "mansion and fetch tea, bread, and butter from a shop in a little place"
110 "two miles beyond, as also a small tin kettle and spirit-lamp, that they"
110 "might get fire without smoke. His re-entry awoke her; and they"

110 "They were indisposed to stir abroad, and the day passed, and the night"

110 "aware, five days had slipped by in absolute seclusion, not a sight or"
110 "sound of a human being disturbing their peacefulness, such as it was."
110 "The changes of the weather were their only events, the birds of the New"
110 "Forest their only company. By tacit consent they hardly once spoke of"
110 "any incident of the past subsequent to their wedding-day. The gloomy"
110 "intervening time seemed to sink into chaos, over which the present and"
110 "prior times closed as if it never had been. Whenever he suggested that"

110 "error forgiven: outside was the inexorable."

110 "They remained yet another day. In the night the dull sky cleared, and"
110 "the result was that the old caretaker at the cottage awoke early. The"
110 "brilliant sunrise made her unusually brisk; she decided to open the"
110 "contiguous mansion immediately, and to air it thoroughly on such a day."
110 "Thus it occurred that, having arrived and opened the lower rooms before"
110 "six o’clock, she ascended to the bedchambers, and was about to turn the"
110 "handle of the one wherein they lay. At that moment she fancied she"
110 "could hear the breathing of persons within. Her slippers and her"
110 "antiquity had rendered her progress a noiseless one so far, and she"
110 "made for instant retreat; then, deeming that her hearing might have"
110 "deceived her, she turned anew to the door and softly tried the handle."
110 "The lock was out of order, but a piece of furniture had been moved"
110 "forward on the inside, which prevented her opening the door more than"
110 "an inch or two. A stream of morning light through the shutter-chink"
110 "fell upon the faces of the pair, wrapped in profound slumber, Tess’s"
110 "lips being parted like a half-opened flower near his cheek. The"
110 "caretaker was so struck with their innocent appearance, and with the"
110 "elegance of Tess’s gown hanging across a chair, her silk stockings"
110 "beside it, the pretty parasol, and the other habits in which she had"
110 "arrived because she had none else, that her first indignation at the"
110 "effrontery of tramps and vagabonds gave way to a momentary"
110 "sentimentality over this genteel elopement, as it seemed. She closed"
110 "the door, and withdrew as softly as she had come, to go and consult"
110 "with her neighbours on the odd discovery."
110 ""
110 "Not more than a minute had elapsed after her withdrawal when Tess woke,"
110 "and then Clare. Both had a sense that something had disturbed them,"
110 "though they could not say what; and the uneasy feeling which it"
110 "engendered grew stronger. As soon as he was dressed he narrowly scanned"
110 "the lawn through the two or three inches of shutter-chink."

110 "“I think we will leave at once,” said he. “It is a fine day. And I"
110 "cannot help fancying somebody is about the house. At any rate, the"
110 "woman will be sure to come to-day.”"
110 ""
110 "She passively assented, and putting the room in order, they took up the"
110 "few articles that belonged to them, and departed noiselessly. When they"
110 "had got into the Forest she turned to take a last look at the house."
110 ""
110 "“Ah, happy house—goodbye!” she said. “My life can only be a question of"
110 "a few weeks. Why should we not have stayed there?”"

110 "the Wessex ports if we are sought at all. When we are in the north we"
110 "will get to a port and away.”"

110 "Having thus persuaded her, the plan was pursued, and they kept a"
110 "bee-line northward. Their long repose at the manor-house lent them"
110 "walking power now; and towards mid-day they found that they were"
110 "approaching the steepled city of Melchester, which lay directly in"
110 "their way. He decided to rest her in a clump of trees during the"
110 "afternoon, and push onward under cover of darkness. At dusk Clare"
110 "purchased food as usual, and their night march began, the boundary"
110 "between Upper and Mid-Wessex being crossed about eight o’clock."
110 ""
110 "To walk across country without much regard to roads was not new to"
110 "Tess, and she showed her old agility in the performance. The"

110 "through in order to take advantage of the town bridge for crossing a"
110 "large river that obstructed them. It was about midnight when they went"
110 "along the deserted streets, lighted fitfully by the few lamps, keeping"
110 "off the pavement that it might not echo their footsteps. The graceful"
110 "pile of cathedral architecture rose dimly on their left hand, but it"
110 "was lost upon them now. Once out of the town they followed the"
110 "turnpike-road, which after a few miles plunged across an open plain."

110 "Though the sky was dense with cloud, a diffused light from some"
110 "fragment of a moon had hitherto helped them a little. But the moon had"
110 "now sunk, the clouds seemed to settle almost on their heads, and the"
110 "night grew as dark as a cave. However, they found their way along,"
110 "keeping as much on the turf as possible that their tread might not"
110 "resound, which it was easy to do, there being no hedge or fence of any"
110 "kind. All around was open loneliness and black solitude, over which a"
110 "stiff breeze blew."

110 "He listened. The wind, playing upon the edifice, produced a booming"
110 "tune, like the note of some gigantic one-stringed harp. No other sound"
110 "came from it, and lifting his hand and advancing a step or two, Clare"
110 "felt the vertical surface of the structure. It seemed to be of solid"
110 "stone, without joint or moulding. Carrying his fingers onward he found"
110 "that what he had come in contact with was a colossal rectangular"
110 "pillar; by stretching out his left hand he could feel a similar one"
110 "adjoining. At an indefinite height overhead something made the black"
110 "sky blacker, which had the semblance of a vast architrave uniting the"
110 "pillars horizontally. They carefully entered beneath and between; the"
110 "surfaces echoed their soft rustle; but they seemed to be still out of"
110 "doors. The place was roofless. Tess drew her breath fearfully, and"
110 "Angel, perplexed, said—"
110 ""
110 "“What can it be?”"
110 ""
110 "Feeling sideways they encountered another tower-like pillar, square and"
110 "uncompromising as the first; beyond it another and another. The place"

110 ""
110 "“A very Temple of the Winds,” he said."

110 "The next pillar was isolated; others composed a trilithon; others were"
110 "prostrate, their flanks forming a causeway wide enough for a carriage;"
110 "and it was soon obvious that they made up a forest of monoliths grouped"
110 "upon the grassy expanse of the plain. The couple advanced further into"
110 "this pavilion of the night till they stood in its midst."

110 "The city of Wintoncester, that fine old city, aforetime capital of"
110 "Wessex, lay amidst its convex and concave downlands in all the"
110 "brightness and warmth of a July morning. The gabled brick, tile, and"
110 "freestone houses had almost dried off for the season their integument"
110 "of lichen, the streams in the meadows were low, and in the sloping High"
110 "Street, from the West Gateway to the mediæval cross, and from the"
110 "mediæval cross to the bridge, that leisurely dusting and sweeping was"
110 "in progress which usually ushers in an old-fashioned market-day."
110 ""
110 "From the western gate aforesaid the highway, as every Wintoncestrian"
110 "knows, ascends a long and regular incline of the exact length of a"
110 "measured mile, leaving the houses gradually behind. Up this road from"
110 "the precincts of the city two persons were walking rapidly, as if"
110 "unconscious of the trying ascent—unconscious through preoccupation and"
110 "not through buoyancy. They had emerged upon this road through a narrow,"
110 "barred wicket in a high wall a little lower down. They seemed anxious"
110 "to get out of the sight of the houses and of their kind, and this road"
110 "appeared to offer the quickest means of doing so. Though they were"
110 "young, they walked with bowed heads, which gait of grief the sun’s rays"
110 "smiled on pitilessly."
110 ""
110 "One of the pair was Angel Clare, the other a tall budding creature—half"
110 "girl, half woman—a spiritualized image of Tess, slighter than she, but"
110 "with the same beautiful eyes—Clare’s sister-in-law, ’Liza-Lu. Their"
110 "pale faces seemed to have shrunk to half their natural size. They moved"
110 "on hand in hand, and never spoke a word, the drooping of their heads"
110 "being that of Giotto’s “Two Apostles”."
110 ""
110 "When they had nearly reached the top of the great West Hill the clocks"
110 "in the town struck eight. Each gave a start at the notes, and, walking"
110 "onward yet a few steps, they reached the first milestone, standing"
110 "whitely on the green margin of the grass, and backed by the down, which"
110 "here was open to the road. They entered upon the turf, and, impelled by"
110 "a force that seemed to overrule their will, suddenly stood still,"
110 "turned, and waited in paralyzed suspense beside the stone."
110 ""
110 "The prospect from this summit was almost unlimited. In the valley"
110 "beneath lay the city they had just left, its more prominent buildings"
110 "showing as in an isometric drawing—among them the broad cathedral"
110 "tower, with its Norman windows and immense length of aisle and nave,"
110 "the spires of St Thomas’s, the pinnacled tower of the College, and,"
110 "more to the right, the tower and gables of the ancient hospice, where"
110 "to this day the pilgrim may receive his dole of bread and ale. Behind"
110 "the city swept the rotund upland of St Catherine’s Hill; further off,"
110 "landscape beyond landscape, till the horizon was lost in the radiance"
110 "of the sun hanging above it."
110 ""
110 "Against these far stretches of country rose, in front of the other city"
110 "edifices, a large red-brick building, with level gray roofs, and rows"
110 "of short barred windows bespeaking captivity, the whole contrasting"
110 "greatly by its formalism with the quaint irregularities of the Gothic"
110 "erections. It was somewhat disguised from the road in passing it by"
110 "yews and evergreen oaks, but it was visible enough up here. The wicket"
110 "from which the pair had lately emerged was in the wall of this"
110 "structure. From the middle of the building an ugly flat-topped"
110 "octagonal tower ascended against the east horizon, and viewed from this"
110 "spot, on its shady side and against the light, it seemed the one blot"
110 "on the city’s beauty. Yet it was with this blot, and not with the"
110 "beauty, that the two gazers were concerned."
110 ""
110 "Upon the cornice of the tower a tall staff was fixed. Their eyes were"
110 "riveted on it. A few minutes after the hour had struck something moved"
110 "slowly up the staff, and extended itself upon the breeze. It was a"
110 "black flag."
110 ""
110 "“Justice” was done, and the President of the Immortals, in Æschylean"
110 "phrase, had ended his sport with Tess. And the d’Urberville knights and"
110 "dames slept on in their tombs unknowing. The two speechless gazers bent"
110 "themselves down to the earth, as if in prayer, and remained thus a long"
110 "time, absolutely motionless: the flag continued to wave silently. As"
110 "soon as they had strength, they arose, joined hands again, and went on."
